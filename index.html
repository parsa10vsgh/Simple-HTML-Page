                    It was the best compliment that he'd ever received although the person who gave it likely never knew. It
                    had
                    been an off-hand observation on his ability to hold a conversation and actually add pertinent
                    information to
                    it on practically any <span style="color: blueviolet;">topic</span>. Although he hadn't consciously
                    strived to be able to do so, he'd started to
                    voraciously read the news when he couldn't keep up on topics his friends discussed because their
                    conversations went above his head. The fact that <span style="color: blue;">someone had noticed enough
                        to compliment him that he could</span>
                    talk intelligently about many topics meant that he had succeeded in his quest to be better informed.

                He had done everything right. There had been no mistakes throughout the entire process. It had been
                perfection and he knew it without a doubt, but the results still stared back at him with the fact that
                he had lost.

                I love the feel of wood curls flying off the lathe as I begin to shape the log in front of me. The sound
                of scraping changes based on the wetness of the wood, the speed at which the lathe is turning, and the
                type of cut I am making. The smell and feel of wet wood being turned are unique. The water is sprayed
                out as I cut through the different layers of wood. A log can turn into anything one's imagination can
                think of with the right set of hands-on tools. I have those hands and imagination. I use all of my
                senses and intuition to create a beautiful object. That is why I enjoy turning wood.

        Nobody really understood Kevin. It wasn't that he was super strange or difficult. It was more that there wasn't
        enough there that anyone wanted to take the time to understand him. This was a shame as Kevin had many of the
        answers to the important questions most people who knew him had. It was even more of a shame that they'd refuse
        to listen even if Kevin offered to give them the answers. So, Kevin remained silent, misunderstood, and kept
        those important answers to life to himself.
